0,"I initially had trouble deciding between the paperwhite and the voyage because reviews more or less said the same thing: the paperwhite is great, but if you have spending money, go for the voyage.Fortunately, I had friends who owned each, so I ended up buying the paperwhite on this basis: both models now have 300 ppi, so the 80 dollar jump turns out pricey the voyage's page press isn't always sensitive, and if you are fine with a specific setting, you don't need auto light adjustment).It's been ...",1,Kindle Devices,The topic primarily discusses experiences and features of Kindle devices.
1,"Allow me to preface this with a little history. I am (was) a casual reader who owned a Nook Simple Touch from 2011. I've read the Harry Potter series, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series, 1984, Brave New World, and a few other key titles.

3,"I bought one of the first Paperwhites and have been very pleased with it its been a constant companion and I suppose Ive read, on average, a book every three days for the past however many years on it. I wouldnt give it up youd have to pry it from my cold dead fingers.For sundry logistical reasons, Ive also made good use of Amazons Kindle app on my iPhone. No Paperwhite screen, naturally, and all the cool usability that delivers, but it works well and has its own attractions as a companion to th...",1,Kindle Devices,The topic primarily discusses experiences and features of Kindle devices.
4,"I have to say upfront - I don't like coroporate, hermetically closed stuff like anything by Apple or in this case, Amazon. I like having devices on which I can put anything I want and use it. But...I was a fairly happy user of a Nook Touch for several years, but couldn't use all its functionalities since I live in Serbia. Then I lost the Nook and since no other devices can actually be fully used in Serbia (buying books with them, using their online capabilities) except the Kindle, and since no o...",1,Kindle Devices,The topic primarily discusses experiences and features of Kindle devices.
5,"My previous kindle was a DX, this is my second kindle in years. Love the form factor and all but I do miss the physical buttons for page turning. There is a glitch in the software though. I use the English interface but occasionally I would like to translate words into traditional Chinese. However, it seems that the traditional Chinese characters cannot display correctly and become small boxes. The simplified Chinese characters can be displayed correctly though.",-1,Outlier/No Clear Topic,Review doesn't fit clearly into any topic

7,"Just got mine right now. Looks the same as the previous generation except for the Kindle logo (it's black this time), feels a little heavier, the screen is a little warmer toned than the previous one, BUT the resolution is SO MUCH BETTER! The 300 ppi are definitely obvious and the new font is worth the money.Totally recommend it for a book lover!I'll give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I am used to a cooler screen, but I'm sure I'll get used to this one soon too :)",1,Kindle Devices,The topic primarily discusses experiences and features of Kindle devices.

10,"As reviewed by the wife This is the perfect thing for a new mommy who loves to read books! As soon as I had my baby girl, I had to stop reading my novels because I had to give the baby my full attention. But how much time do I spend laying in bed, on my side, with the baby while she feeds Especially prior to 4 months when feeding took as long as 45 minutes!

Had not the UPS been so square (they think everyone sits at home all day) I had received it a day earlier.I am very pleased with the e-reader, easy on the eyes, and comfortable to hold in one hand.

I LOVE the dictionary on this little device. Normally I just skip a word I don't know the meaning of and try to guess what it means in the context but with kindle, I just press and hold my finger on the word I don't know and translation pops up! so essentially, the meaning of a new word is at your finger tips! )If you l...",1,Kindle Devices,The topic primarily discusses experiences and features of Kindle devices.

The user guide didn't really answer my questions, but I persisted am getting used to it. I really love the backlit screen no buttons to push to change pages.

21,I already had an original Kindle Paperwhite and loved it. Buying this in addition seemed like a bit of an indulgence but I am so pleased I made this move. I love the new font and the clarity of the screen. I love that the Kindle comes to life when I open the cover (I bought a new cover with the magnetic clasp). While there is nothing dramatic about the evolving of the Kindle there are enough changes and improvements for me to feel I have made a great purchase which I am happy with.

No they aren't essential to my life but I love playing music, listening to the news and controlling the Philips Hue smart lights throughout my home. It was a large investment that most of the population won't make - with that being said I am not a huge fan of the way the hockey puck Dots look like.

When in Parent mode (password protected), the Fire 7 looks and feels just like an Android tablet with all of the Fire 7 functionality (Facebook, Netflix, Books, blah, blah), so all of us Android users feel right at home.

My only complaint is that you cannot separate downloaded apps from the thousands of apps available to download on freetime.

Only downside is, if you also own an Echo, when you push the button on the Tap to speak to Alexa, since she is always listening on the Echo, she tends to pick up your commands on the Echo as well.
